## Chess Clock

This was was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and can be run with its usual set of commands.

Bottom buttons are for clocks' accuracy in milliseconds, and after the game is interrupted or either of clocks expires, the difference between time measured by clocks and the difference between start and end time's timestamps obtained by Date.now is displayed.
